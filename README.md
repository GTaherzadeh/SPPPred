## Data Files

-Protein-peptide dataset are stored in Dataset.zip.Dataset file contains:

-Data.Set.py

- Test.Set.txt

- Train.Set.txt

- Test.Labels.txt

- Train.Labels.txt


## Guide

-There are three lines for each sample that include seq label, the chain sequence, and the enriched binding annotation:  0=non-binding,1=binding, respectively.

-There are two files that contain labels for Test.Set and Train. Set.


## Code Files

- SPPPred_model.py 

- arch2.py

- Utils.py




## Guide

Run in Linux: python SPPPred_model.py for peptide binding residues prediction.

SPPPred_model.py is the main file.

Provide all above files in one folder and run the SPPPred_mode.py file.
